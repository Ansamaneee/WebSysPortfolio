                    <p>I am a college student. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that 
					I like to study. My favorite subjects are programming and computer networking. I am going to enter the academy because my 
					goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a respected IT professional in one of the fields.
					I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to 
					communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, 
					the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. 
					I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
					My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting guy with a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who 
					are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values 
					in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate 
					friendship and people who surround me.<p/>
